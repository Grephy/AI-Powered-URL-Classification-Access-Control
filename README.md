# AI-Powered-URL-Classification-Access-Control
Web Guard enhances online security using ML to classify URLs &amp; control website access. Addressing cyber threats like phishing, malware, &amp; defacement, it employs comprehensive URL analysis from preprocessing to real-time prediction. By categorizing URLs , it trains ML models to identify associated patterns, mitigating risks effectively.

Web Guard is an innovative project aimed at enhancing online security by leveraging machine learning algorithms to classify URLs and control website access. With the increasing prevalence of cyber threats such as phishing attacks, malware infections, and defacement attempts, there is a growing need for robust systems that can accurately identify and mitigate these risks.

## Key Features

- **URL Classification**: Utilizes machine learning models to classify URLs into different categories, including benign, phishing, malware, and defacement.
  
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Offers a user-friendly interface for seamless interaction, allowing users to input URLs and receive real-time predictions on their maliciousness.

- **Access Control**: Provides functionality for managing a blocklist of websites, enabling users to selectively allow or deny access to specific sites.

- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Incorporates a comprehensive approach to URL analysis, starting from data preprocessing to model training and real-time prediction.
